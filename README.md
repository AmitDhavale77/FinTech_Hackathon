# Squid - Dynamic Credit Scoring System
Project Overview
Squid is a FinTech startup concept designed to revolutionize credit scoring by incorporating real-time debit transactions. Unlike traditional static credit scores, Squid provides a dynamic credit score that reflects a user's ongoing financial behavior. This project was first proposed during a FinTech Hackathon.

The core innovation is the use of a semi-supervised learning technique combining Clustering and Fuzzy Logic to generate personalized credit scores based on daily financial activity.

Key Features
Dynamic Credit Scoring: Credit scores adapt based on real-time debit transactions made through the Squid app.
Fuzzy Logic & Clustering: Leverages advanced machine learning techniques to provide more accurate credit profiles.
User-Centric Interface: Designed to encourage users to manage their finances through a seamless app interface.
Incentivized Financial Responsibility: Users are rewarded for responsible debit transactions and credit management.
Application Design
The design for the Squid app was created using Figma. You can explore the user interface below:

Technologies Used
Figma: For UI/UX design and prototyping.
Python: For developing the machine learning algorithm.
Semi-Supervised Learning: Using Clustering and Fuzzy Logic for credit score calculation.
PowerPoint: For the presentation.
How It Works
Users register and link their bank accounts to the Squid app.
All debit transactions are monitored in real-time.
A dynamic credit score is calculated using the semi-supervised algorithm, which adapts based on user behavior.
Users receive rewards and feedback based on their financial management.
Future Development
This repository will be continuously updated with:

Algorithm Implementation: Code for the clustering and fuzzy logic-based credit scoring model.
App Prototype: Further development of the appâ€™s backend and functionality.
Documentation: Detailed explanation of the machine learning model and decision-making process.
